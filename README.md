# TwitterBOT
In this Twitter bot, I harnessed the power of Selenium and Python to automate the process of sending a tweet whenever my internet speed falls below a certain threshold. By leveraging Selenium's web automation capabilities and Python's scripting prowess, I created a seamless solution that monitors my internet connection and takes proactive action if the speed drops below the predefined limit. With this innovative approach, I ensure that my followers stay informed about my connectivity challenges and engage in real-time conversations about internet performance.
